# Disaster-Tweet-Analysis
## An analysis on Disaster Management Tweets and their Relevancy using NLP

### Problem Statement:
In the context of Twitter's crucial role in disseminating disaster-related information, the project aims to enhance the accuracy of alerts by distinguishing real data from casual language often misinterpreted by the platform's algorithms. Leveraging Machine Learning and data from Twitter, the objective is to improve disaster management through the identification of genuine information and trends in keyword usage.

### Overview of the Project Step by Step
* **Data Collection:** Gathering comprehensive data on disasters from Twitter (X)
* **Data Preprocessing:** Performing data preprocessing tasks like cleaning, normalization, and feature selection
* **Explanatory Data Analysis:** Analyzing and visualizing the data to understand patterns and distributions
* **Data Modeling (NLP)** creating NLP using RNN model
* **Model Testing and Result:** Evaluating the NLP model with the testing data
